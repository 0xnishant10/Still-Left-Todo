## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### 1. 📥 Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jwt-auth-todo-app.git
cd jwt-auth-todo-app

Or download the ZIP and extract it.

### 2. 📦 Install dependencies

### 3. 🛠️ Configure environment variables
Create a .env file in the root folder and add:
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_user:your_password@cluster.mongodb.net
